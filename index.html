    <h1>Welcome to the Matching Game</h1>
    <div><p>Click on a clown to reveal the image behind it. Each image will have an identical
        image and whenever you found the pair they will stay revealed. Each time you click on
        an image, your score will increase by one so you're really good if you have the lowest 
        amount of points which is 16. Click on the reset button to reset the game. The images are 
        randomized every time you reload the game so don't try memorizing the positions. Good luck!</p>
